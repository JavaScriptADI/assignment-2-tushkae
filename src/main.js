// 6) Declare a variable with the value of "Hello". Convert the value to upper case and print the converted value to the console.
let hello = "Hello";
hello = hello.toUpperCase();
console.log(hello);

// 7) Declare another variable with the value of "World". Convert the value to lower case and print the converted value to the console.

// ðŸ˜Ž Given code:
// let text = 'Hello';

// let age = prompt('How old are you?');
// let nextAge = age + 1;
// console.log(Next year you will be ${nextAge});
let age1 = prompt('How old are you?');
let nextAge = parseInt(age1) + 1;
console.log(`Next year you will be ${nextAge}`);

// 12) Finish the code:
let name = prompt('What is your name?');
let age = Number(prompt('How old are you?'));
let isInSixties = age >= 60 && age <70; // finish the code so that it prints true if the age is in 60s
console.log(`${name} is in sixties: ${isInSixties}`);

// 13) What is the value of x?
let x = 5;
console.log(x++);

// Answer: y value will be 5.

// 15) What is x++ and x--
// Answer: x++ is example of increment by one and y-- is example of decrement by one

// 16) What is the difference between ++x and x++?
// Answer: Pre-Increment (++x) the variable is incremented first, and then the updated value. Post-Increment (x++) The variable's current value is used first, and then the increment occurs.
